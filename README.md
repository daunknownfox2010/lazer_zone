# Lazer Zone
Lazer Zone is a gamemode for Garry's Mod that consists of various different game types. The gamemode is unique as the rule set is different from what most people expect for a Lazer Tag game.

## Game types
* Team (Blue vs. Red vs. Yellow)
* Deathmatch (all vs. all)

## Rule set
* The team/player with the most points is the winner.
* The gamemode has *base points* which users can destroy for lots of points.
* You only have **one** weapon and that's the Lazer Gun.
* In the general game types, being shot ***once*** will lead to user death.
* The gamemode can change depending on the selected game type.
* There are various power-ups users can get.
* The gamemode is planned to be flexible to allow for different game types.
